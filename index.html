            My name is Manja Wilson. I'm 33 and I've been a stay-at-home mom for the last 7 years.

        <h3 id="Background" class="paragraph">Background</h3>     
        <p>I was born and raised in Germany, where I graduated from High School in 2008, and then came to the US to be an Au Pair. <br>
        My time as an Au Pair wasn't always easy, but it prepared me in a lot of ways for being a mom myself.
        It also gave me the opportunity to travel a little within the US. <br>
        Between 2009 and 2010 I visited the Poconos (PA), Atlanta, Virginia, San Francisco, Miami, Myrtle Beach, and Hawaii.<br> 
        While I was still an Au Pair, I met my husband, Joe, and after my Au Pair time was over, I stayed with him and 
        we got married in 2011.<br>
        Over the years I worked in different retail jobs and eventually as a bank teller.

        <h3 id="Family" class="paragraph">Family</h3>
        <p> <img class="fam" src="famportfolio.jpg" alt="...Picture of the Wilsons...">
            My immediate family consists of myself, my husband, Joe, our daughter, Amy, and our dog, Lucy.
        <a href="lucy.html">This is Lucy</a> <br>
        Most of Joe's family live fairly close to us, but all of my family still lives in Germany. 
        I have an older brother and sister, a niece and nephew and my mom over there. <br>
        It's pretty hard and expensive to fly to Germany more than every few years or so, 
        so unfortunately I don't see my family often.<br>
        But Joe's family is so great and they are there for us whenever we need anything.

        <h3 id="Hobbies" class="paragraph">Hobbies</h3>
        <p>During my time as a stay-at-home mom I tought myself a few new skills. With the help of
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> I learned how to knit, crochet, and make my own soaps. <br>
        I love being crafty and creating or designing things. <br>
        I also love to read, watch TV / Movies, and being outdoors when the weather is nice.<br> 
        I take lots of walks with my daughter when it's nice out, and in the summer we love to go to the beach.

        <p>I have absolutely no experience with coding. I consider myself to posess about average computer skills: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>researching things online</li>
            <li>online shopping</li>
            <li>the occasional word document or excel sheet</li>
        </ul> 
        But I like to think I am a quick study and I am always willing and excited to learn new skills.<br>
        I have a friend who works from home doing what I now am sure is considered data analysis.<br> 
        Over the years I tried to get a job at the same company a couple of times, but have never gotten anywhere.<br>
        A job from home would be ideal for me, being that I have to be home for my daughter before and after school, 
        when she is sick,<br> and during the summer and other school breaks.<br>
        Then I recently heard of someone attending a coding bootcamp and then getting a job working from home.<br>
        They recommended Coding Temple, so I did some research. 
        Finding out I could learn a lot in a fairly short amount of time,<br>
        and not being $30,000, $40,000 or even more in debt afterwards, I was sold. <br>
        I already have a feeling that this was a great decision. I haven't even started classes yet, 
        and I feel that I have already learned a ton!<br> 
        I mean, look at me creating this website!! 
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">*Please be aware that at the time this website was created, my bootcamp hadn't started yet.</p>
